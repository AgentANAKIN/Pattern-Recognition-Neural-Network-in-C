# Pattern-Recognition-Neural-Network-in-C
<p>This simple neural network was originally written in Python (https://www.sololearn.com/learn/738/?ref=app). I converted it to C to deepen my understanding of both languages, as well as of neural networks.</p>
<p>This neural network recognizes a pattern. If the 1st number in the set is 1, then the output is 1.</p>
